Welcome to the sonart project!

In this project we used openkinect to detect the presence & position of a person in order to offer more information about a piece of art (Rinocrétaire) in the "art décoratifs" museum.
Here is a demonstration video: http://youtu.be/f18OT1uiAIs
...and here is a webpage presenting the project : http://tangibledisplay.com/gallery/sonart

The system is composed of:
-a kinect to detect visitors
-a mini-PC with ubuntu and processing.org to get the data from the kinect
-a video projector to display the information

Here is the scenario:
-if a visitor is far, the device gives general information
-if he gets closer, some details are shown
-if he gets too close an alarm sound & animation is played

This project is the result of a scolar course that finished in the "Arts Décoratifs" muséum at the Louvres, Paris. Here is the course website: http://codesignlab.wp.institut-telecom.fr/2010/10/digital-creation10-student-works

Enjoy !
